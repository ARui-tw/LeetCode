## 📝 About

This repository contains my LeetCode problem solutions, primarily written in C++. Each solution is organized in its own directory with proper documentation and optimized code.

## 📁 Repository Structure

```
LeetCode/
├── README.md                 # This file
├── solution-template.sh      # Script to create new problem templates
└── problems/                 # All problem solutions

```

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Creating a New Solution

Use the provided template script to quickly set up a new problem:

```bash
./solution-template.sh "123. Problem Title"
```

This will:
- Create a directory `problems/0123-Problem_Title/`
- Generate a `sol.cpp` file with proper header comments
- Include the LeetCode problem URL
- Open the file in vim for editing

### Solution Format

Each solution follows this structure:

```cpp
/**
 * Author: ARui<mail@arui.dev>
 * Problem: https://leetcode.com/problems/problem-name
 * Runtime: X ms (Y.YY%)
 */

// Solution code here
```
